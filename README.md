Your solution must be developed using an Angular front-end app that calls a C# .NET Core back-end restful API.

 

At a minimum, the front-end UI should consist of:

* A list of the newest stories

* Each list item should include the title and a link to the news article.  Watch out for stories that do not have hyperlinks!

* A search feature that allows users to find stories

* A paging mechanism.  While we love reading, 200 stories on the page is a bit much.

* Automated tests for your code

 

At a minimum, the back-end API should consist of:

* Usage of dependency injection, it's built-in so why not?

* Caching of the newest stories

* Automated tests for your code

 

While we would love seeing an Angular only solution to this problem, we really need to see your CSharpness.

 

If you're up for it, upload your code challenge to an Azure website and send us the link!  Azure websites have free trial periods so you don't have to pay a dime :)
