# HackerNewsProject
Features:

- [x] A list of the newest stories

- [x] Each list item should include the title and a link to the news article.  Watch out for stories that do not have hyperlinks!

- [x] A search feature that allows users to find stories

- [x] A paging mechanism.  While we love reading, 200 stories on the page is a bit much. (server-side)

- [x] Automated tests for your code

- [x] Usage of dependency injection, it's built-in so why not?

- [x] Caching of the newest stories

- [x] If you're up for it, upload your code challenge to an Azure website and send us the link!  Azure websites have free trial periods so you don't have to pay a dime :) https://wonderful-hill-02edb720f.azurestaticapps.net/#/
